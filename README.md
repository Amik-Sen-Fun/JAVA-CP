# Introduction 

#### Why JAVA and not C++?
- C++ is platform dependent. The excutable file of C++ might run on one platform and not on another
- Java solves this problem. It generates a JavaByte Code that can be run on any machine through JVM.
- This concept was used later on by Python and C#. 
- Java provides monitoring facilities as well
- No pointers in JAVA so more secure. 
- It is statically typed language

To run JAVA codes we need a JDK. 
- JDK (Java Development Kit) = JRE (Java Runtime Environment) + Dev Tools 
- JRE = JVM (Java Virtual Machine) + Java class library 
- JRE can be implemented in 2 ways: 
  - Just in time compilation: Compiles bytecode into native machine code at run time.
  - Interpreters : Not preffered usually 

- Camel case for variable is standard in Java
- upper case for constant is standard in Java

### Primitive DataTypes

- __byte__ : -128 to 127
- __bool__
- __int__
- __long__
- __float__
- __char__


- For floating points number use `12.0f`
- For Double use `12.0d`
